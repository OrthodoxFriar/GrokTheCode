# Just the Beginning

## Do something, fast.

Something happened in September of 2019, I knew that I was about to make some changes. At 205 lbs I was having some trouble doing my work as a Handyman. Nothing really serious, a little in the knees, slower going up the ladder than I liked, that sort of thing. It would only get worse with time and I can't afford to be out of work.
