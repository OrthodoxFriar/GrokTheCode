## What it is

**Grok**  
*To understand profoundly through intuition or empathy.*

## Pandoc Markdown

Well written 'Pandoc Markdown' will convert to predictable error free HTML every time. Since the conversion is so predictable the styles can be applied with precision and there are a hundred other formats that the markdown file can be converted to.

## Emacs and Vim

Yes, I use both, they have different strengths. I'm not trying to start a fight with anyone but Emacs and Vim *feel* different depending on what you are doing. Each is full featured and capable in the extreme and I love them both. I usually like to use Emacs when I am writing a document out from the top down in a more or less linear way and I don't usually have numbers on. I usually like to use Vim when I am editing through a document or through several configuration files for example, I do find it faster jumping around in a buffer in Vim.
