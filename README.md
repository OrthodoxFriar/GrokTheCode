**Grok**  
*To understand profoundly through intuition or empathy.*

## Precision Matters

### 2 Universal Rules

1. The power of any language is derived directly from it's rules.
2. Given 2 choices of programming language, humans will always choose the less constrained and easier to learn.

The now settled debate between HTML and XHTML shows the truth of these 2 rules. XHTML is vastly more powerful through it's ability to be extended but because you must follow the rules, it actually consumes fewer resources. Open a browser with half a dozen tabs and then look at the system resources being used, Windows XP would run on the resources consumed by a modern browser, compare that to an XML processor.

Now find a few random sites that look nice and run them through a validator. Usually any given site will have 2 or 3 dozen errors and there is a 50-50 chance that it was software generated and contains nothing but javascript pulling in resources. Loose rules promote sloppy code.

I might sound biased but I do *get* the other side. HTML was destined to win and js will always be more popular than haskell as long as it is easier to learn.

## Literate Programming

So called 'Modern Methodologies' in programming put the emphasis on producing code leaving documentation secondary (which means it never happens). I don't use software that comes without documentation for a couple of reasons. First, it's like being in a pitch dark room searching for a doorhandle and second, there are features perhaps important features that you will never discover. Whenever I look at a new piece of software I look for the docs first and if there is no documentation I don't waste my time.

Literate programming lives on a scale between **well documented code** and a **programming book** with code in it. As with anything else different projects will call for more or less documentation. A little bit of effort in the beginning will make self documenting code easy.

## Pandoc Markdown

Well written 'Pandoc Markdown' will convert to predictable error free HTML every time. Since the conversion is so predictable the styles can be applied with precision and there are 3 dozen other formats that the markdown file can be converted to including 'Literate Haskell'.

## Emacs and Vim

Yes, I use both, they have different strengths. I'm not trying to start a fight with anyone but Emacs and Vim *feel* different depending on what you are doing. Each is full featured and capable in the extreme and I love them both. I usually like to use Emacs when I am writing a document out from the top down in a more or less linear way and I don't usually have numbers on. I usually like to use Vim when I am editing through a document or through several configuration files for example, I do find it faster jumping around in a buffer in Vim.
